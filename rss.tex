\section{Rectangular Swept Spheres}
\label{rss}


\subsection{Representation of RSS}
I have chosen to represent the RSS as a rectangle in 3D together with a radius, as described in \cite{larsen00fast}, \cite{Larsen99fastproximity} and \cite{237244}. The rectangle is made up from a 3d point which is its center, 2 unit vectors in 3d which describes the slope \fixme{is this a correct term} of the rectangle, and the length of the of the original 3d vectors.

I have choosen this implementation, since \cite{327244} uses it, and I intend to use the overlap algorithm found in \cite{237244}.
