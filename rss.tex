\section{Rectangular Swept Spheres}
\label{rss}

\subsection{Introduction}
In this section I will go into greater detail about the RSS, how it is defined and represented, as well as the literature that I have used in this report. I will also shortly describe Point Swept Spheres (PSS) and Line Swept Spheres (LSS), which are related to RSS'. No other bounding volumes will be described. 

\subsection{Rectangular Swept Sphere}
The Rectangular Swept Sphere (RSS) is a 3D figure. It is generated by taking a sphere with a non-zero radius and sweeping it over a rectangle in 3 dimensional space. This makes it r it resemble a rectangular rounded pillow. An illustration of a RSS can be found in figure \ref{rss-example-figure} on page \pageref{rss-example-figure}. 

\subsection{Representation of RSS}
I have chosen to represent the RSS as a rectangle in 3D together with a radius, as described in \cite{larsen00fast}, \cite{Larsen99fastproximity} and \cite{237244}. The rectangle is represented by 2 vectors, both of their length, as well as a center point. See section \ref{rectangle3d} page \pageref{rectangle3d} for  implementation details. I felt this was best way to represent it, as it adequately described the RSS, took up a minimum of space, contains the vectors, and follows the representation found in \cite{237244}, which is useful, as I use the axis-separation test described in the article.

\subsection{Overlap of 2 RSS'}
\Sfixme{think about whether this is important enough to warrant a section and if so mention how we find out when 2 RSS' are intersecting}

\subsection{Point Swept Spheres}
A point swept sphere is a BV that is created by taking a point p in 3D, and placing the center point of a sphere s with a positive radius at p. The advantage of the PSS is that it is both simple to implement and to check to for intersection with other PSS. PSS are however, not a very tight-fit, since they are however not have a very tight fit, and is therefore likely to necessitate more intersection checks in practice, than other BVs, such as LSS' (see below) or RSS'.

\subsection{Line Swept Spheres}
A line swept sphere is a BV that is created by taking a line segment l, placing the center point of a sphere s with a positive radius on one of the endpoints of l, and then sliding s to the other endpoint of l. It is a bit harder to check for intersection for LSS' than it is for PSS' (see above), but LSS will often in practice have a tighter fit to the points it contains, and will therefore create fewer unneeded checks for intersection than PSS'.\Sfixme{Do I have to argument for this claim, and if so, which arguments can I use}
