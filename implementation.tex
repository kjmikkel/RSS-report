\section{Implementation}
\label{implementation}

\subsection{Introduction}
In this section I will give an overview of the implementation details of this projects. This will include choice of programming language, a discussion about the possible algorithms that could have been used \Sfixme{should this part be in the algorithm section, and if so should there be an reordering of the sections?}, extra libraries that I have found useful, as well as an overview of the classes and files that I have added to the framework.

\subsection{Choice of programming language}
Since the goal of this project is to implement the Rectangular Swept Sphere into the [whatever] \fixme{what is the framework called - found out} Java framework, there has never been any doubt that as much as possible of this project should be implemented in Java - only using other languages if there were already existing, and efficient code, that implemented critical features, which were to much work to be implemented.

\subsection{Use of Framework}
Since this project is about implementing RSS in to [whatever framework], I will make heavy use of the features already existing in the framework. This will be done both to save time and avoid code duplication, but also under the assumption that the implemented features will be more efficient than what I myself could implement.
