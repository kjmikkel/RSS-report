\abstract{
  Protein folding is a important method for finding new and better drugs. In order to ensure that the proteins can exist in reality, each fold (in the domain known as conformation) has to be checked, to see if it does not make the protein overlap itself. One method is using a Bounding Volume Hierarchies, which can be used to efficiently compare Bounding Volumes. I have in this project implemented the Rectangular Swept Sphere Bounding Volume (which is generated by sweeping the center point of a sphere through a rectangle in 3d), and attempted to implement the overlap detection found in ``Fast Distance Queries with Rectangular Swept Sphere Volumes'' by Larsen et al. The current implementation has been tested against both Oriented Bounding Boxes and Linear Swept Sphere, and has been shown to be inferiour to both. However, it is my estimate that this is because the current implementaion suffers from a misunderstanding of the method described in the above article, and that if implemented correctly it could prove more efficient than Oriented Bounding Boxes..
