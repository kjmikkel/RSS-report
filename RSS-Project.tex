\abstract{
  Protein folding is a important method for finding new and better drugs. In order to ensure that the proteins can exist in reality, each fold has to be checked, to see if its possible. One method is using a Bounding Volume Hierarchies, which can be used to efficiently compare Bounding Volumes. I have in this project implemented the Rectangular Swept Sphere Bounding Volume, which is generated by taking a spheres, and moving its midpoint through all points of a 3 dimensional rectangle, and tested it against Oriented Bounding Boxes and Linear Swept Spheres. The current implementation of the Rectangular Swept Sphere is inferior to both, and it is my estimate that at best it will be just as efficient as Oriented Bounding Boxes.
