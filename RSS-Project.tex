\abstract{
  Protein folding is a important method for finding new and better drugs. In order to ensure that the folded proteins are legal, each fold has to be checked to see if its legal. One method of doing this is by using Bounding volumes. I have in this project implemented the Rectangular Swept Sphere Bounding Volume, and tested it against Oriented Bounding Boxes and Linear Swept Spheres. The current implementation of the Rectangular Swept Sphere is in its current implementation inferiour to both, but I belive that with there is sufficient room for improvement that it could be at least as good as Oriented Bounding Boxes.
